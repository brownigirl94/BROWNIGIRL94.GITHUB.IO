		<h1> My Code </h1>
		<p> A lot of the work I've done in the past has been privately owned by private companies. However, 2018 is a new year, and I'm planning to start contributing to open source projects. You can take a look at my contributions on <a href="https://github.com/brownigirl94">my Github profile</a>.

		That's all for now!
